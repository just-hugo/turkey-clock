This is a Thanksgiving Countdown Clock. It is a simple tool to display the date of the next Thanksgiving, followed by a countdown until the event. This countdown is intended to be embedded in [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) pages, to assist in planning the logistics of a successful Thanksgiving dinner -- particularly the process of thawing, brining, and roasting the turkey.

To view the clock, visit https://just-hugo.github.io/turkey-clock/ or paste the URL into a Notion page and select the Embed option.
